# AutoSkin
#### Automatically generate, apply, and add to NameMC, skinart.
NameMC displays your skin history in a grid form, in order of history of skins. This bot can generate skins for you from an image, and then apply them, to create an image from the grid of skin history.

# How to use:

#### Set the "image.png" to be a 72x24 image, and then run "main.py"

#### To run "main.py," open command prompt, type "cd <folder>" until you're in the active folder, and then run "python main.py" or "python3 main.py"
